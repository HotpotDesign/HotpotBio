# HotpotBio Introduction
My name is Clarence Hu, and I'm the founder of a computer vision-language startup named Hotpot.ai.

Because Hotpot is restricted from sharing GenAI research, I founded this informal group so Hotpot could give back to science via biomedicine.

HotpotBio is inspired by open source where ephemeral groups can drive innovation by attracting talent across organizational boundaries.

Ideally, the world magically cures cancer and creates AI doctors tomorrow, allowing this group to dissolve.

HotpotBio only exists because there are too many open questions.

# Problem
Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, claiming the lives of roughly 10 million people per year and devastating the lives of millions more [1].

There are about 8 billion people and 12.7 million doctors. Human doctors cannot bridge this gap and provide the personalized healthcare everyone deserves.

# North Star
The mission for HotpotBio is to advance cancer research and AI doctors with open research [2].

While curing cancer and AI doctors are fantasies today, many groups are working feverishly to close the gap between dream and reality.

One day, it is my belief that everyone will enjoy personalized healthcare supervised by Stanford-caliber AI doctors.

We hope to play a tiny part.

Even if the dream never materializes, it is better to aim for the stars and land on the mountains than to not aim at all.

# Challenge
Quality datasets and benchmarks can unlock rapid progress in machine learning (ML), but most technologists lack medical expertise while most doctors lack technical expertise.

Without better datasets and evaluations, it is hard to train models and improve AI -- not unlike teaching students with incomplete textbooks and practice exams.

# Purpose
Our primary objective is to package medical knowledge into a format suitable for engineers and researchers to further AI biomedicine, regardless of medical background.

Concretely, we will focus on publishing datasets and benchmarks in collaboration with medical professionals from Stanford, UCSF, and other leading institutions.

We will finetune and develop models, as resources permit.

# AI Doctor Research
The research is broadly organized into the categories below. Descriptions are tailored for non-technical audiences.

## AI Vision
- Surgery: how to provide real-time anatomy detection for surgeons and self-paced video education for residents?
- Medical imaging: how to improve detection of disease, musculoskeletal injury, and anatomical abnormalities, both in the clinic and in telemedicine?

## AI Hearing
- Biomedical transcription: how to transcribe audio, particularly conversations with heavy accents?

## AI Reading
- Biomedical RAG factuality: how to accurately answer questions given a specific context?
- Biomedical text understanding: how to extract information and entities from both structured and unstructured text?
- Biomedical reliability: how to achieve consistency across identical conditions?

## AI Privacy
- Biomedical privacy: how to preserve patient confidentiality while expanding datasets and facilitating multi-institute collaboration?

## AI Reasoning
- Biomedical reasoning: how to ensure diagnoses and recommendations match expert clinical judgment?

# Cancer Research
Our research investigates Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cancer, concentrating on the topics below.

Viruses cause cervical cancer, Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), and several other cancer types, but the data is inconclusive for more common cancer types like breast cancer and lung cancer [3-8].

- Joint Omics Adaptive Nosological (JOAN) detection framework: systematic computational-experimental framework for detecting viruses in cancer samples, starting with adenocarcinomas.
- EBV sequence conservation.
- EBV association with breast cancer, starting with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
- EBV association with lung cancer, starting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- EBV association with NPC, Burkitt lymphoma, and gastric cancer.
- EBV association with MYC.
- 1K TNBC dataset: see below.

# Call for Collaboration
We invite interested parties from both academia and industry to reach out.

For aspiring founders, we hope to play matchmaker between medical professionals and technical individuals. Startups are an excellent vehicle for translating theoretical insights into real world benefits, and we are happy to help.

We welcome contributors in the areas below. If you represent an area not listed, please feel free to suggest ideas.

## Healthcare
- Oncology
- Virology
- Surgery
- Pediatrics
- Neurology
- Cardiology
- Pulmonology
- Radiology
- Geriatrics
- Gastroenterology
- Pathology
- Endocrinology
- Hematology
- Bioinformatics
- Genomics
- Clinical investigations

Contributions can fit any schedule and take one of many forms:
- Creating 100-200 multiple choice questions per specialty
- Reviewing questions
- Defining key clinical tasks and requirements
- Conducting lit reviews
- Reviewing paper drafts

Question creation takes 5-15 hours with our current AI workflow, but we plan to streamline the process further.

## Machine Learning
- VLM
- Computer vision
- NLP
- LLM

## Software Development
- Full-stack web development

# Research Culture
HotpotBio focuses on science, deferring policy and ethics to other forums.

Although this position may not appeal to all, the benefit of clear values is cultivating an environment where everyone can concentrate on science. Organizational theory demonstrates that teams united by shared priorities and explicit expectations tend to foster more productive collaborations.

I understand the anxiety around AI, but our culture is rooted in a deep study of technology history and societal progress. Throughout time, a consistent pattern has characterized the emergence of disruptive technology. This cycle was observed with books, computers, the web, and it's repeating again with AI. Fear dominates the discourse while concerned critics seek to curb capabilities and protect the masses.
With hindsight, we know those noble intentions were misguided and failed to account for the transformative benefits spawned by innovation. General technology, by definition, is wieldable for good or bad, but the good vastly outweighs the bad. This propels the world to greater heights of prosperity and accessibility.

On ethics, most people aspire to be moral and responsible, but the challenge is: whose values dictate tradeoffs and resolve disputes? Officials from California, Texas, China, India, France, Japan, the UK, Saudi Arabia, or where? Whose risk profile shines the way forward? For instance, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 were all considered too dangerous for the average person, but those worries proved exaggerated at best and unfounded at worst. Moreover, it's presumptuous to assume one jurisdiction can bottle up software ingenuity or constrain global innovation. If America surrenders AI leadership, other nations will readily fill the void.

While healthy people can afford the luxury of endless deliberation, the sick cannot. With nearly 800K people passing away each month from cancer, discovering breakthroughs even one month sooner can save lives and spare immeasurable suffering.

Intelligent people may disagree. I respect different opinions and hope others can as well.

# TNBC Dataset Donations
Funding the TNBC dataset is a powerful, efficient way to push cancer research forward.

This one dataset could power tens to hundreds of studies and hopefully set a new precedent for tackling tumor subtypes.

Human researchers need data as much as AI models, but the system does not incentivize anyone to invest in big datasets for tumor subtypes, even lethal ones like TNBC. Academics are motivated to diversify grants across multiple initiatives while clinicians are encouraged to focus on immediate impact. We seek to create an award-winning dataset based on 1,000 TNBC tumor samples and share the data globally.

Donations are made directly to Stanford.

No one from HotpotBio financially benefits, nor does anyone need to be involved beyond advising on dataset guidelines and how to ensure proceeds finance data and not administrative overhead.

The more data we give researchers, the sooner they can potentially uncover new screening programs and targeted therapies for TNBC.

# OpenAI, GoogleDeepMind, X, AWS, and Anthropic
We can create clean datasets and difficult benchmarks, but long context, image, and video evaluations of frontier models are expensive. Credits and other support would accelerate these into reality. We welcome partnerships with AI leaders to advance benchmarks and datasets for biomedicine.
